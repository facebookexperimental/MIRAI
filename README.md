# MIRAI

MIRAI is an abstract interpreter for the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) compiler's [mid-level intermediate
representation](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1211-mir.md) (MIR).

It started out as a Facebook project, but became orphaned when the sponsoring organization was disbanded.

Ongoing work to keep the project alive now happens at https://github.com/endorlabs/MIRAI.
